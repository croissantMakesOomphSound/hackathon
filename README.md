Project Methodology Description
<br># Object detection using deep learning with OpenCV and Python 

OpenCV `dnn` module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow. 

When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are
 * YOLO
 * SSD
 * Faster R-CNN
 
 Support for running YOLO/DarkNet has been added to OpenCV dnn module recently. 
 
 ## Dependencies
  * opencv
  * numpy
  
`pip install numpy opencv-python`

 **Command format** 
 
 _$ python yolo_opencv.py --image /path/to/input/image --config /path/to/config/file --weights /path/to/weights/file --classes /path/to/classes/file_

 ### sample output :

Checkout the object detection implementation available in [cvlib](http:cvlib.net) which enables detecting common objects in the context through a single function call `detect_common_objects()`.
 
 
 (_SSD and Faster R-CNN examples will be added soon_)
<br>
mainproject.py is our final project formed from the other tested prototypes(untitled1.py and untitled2.py)
<br>
untitled1.py deals with json storage <br>
untitled2.py deals with yolo model
